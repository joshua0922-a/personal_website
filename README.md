## About

This project is a responsive personal portfolio website built with Next.js and React.  
It features multiple sections including About Me, Skills, Education, Certifications, Work Experience, and a Contact Form.  

The contact form is integrated with Firebase Firestore to save inquiries in real-time. The site uses modern React features like `useState`, `useTransition`, and CSS utilities from TailwindCSS for styling and responsiveness.  

It is designed to be easily customizable for IT students, developers, or anyone wanting to showcase their skills and experience online.
